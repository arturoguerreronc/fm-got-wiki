            <span class="date">~10,000 BC</span>
            <p>
              A legendary period during which many of the noble houses of
              Westeros trace their founding. This era saw the rise of Bran the
              Builder, who constructed the Wall and founded House Stark, and
              Lann the Clever, who acquired Casterly Rock and founded House
              Lannister.

              A winter that lasted a generation, during which the White Walkers
              descended upon Westeros from the far north, bringing with them
              cold and darkness. They were ultimately defeated in the Battle for
              the Dawn, after which the Wall was constructed to prevent their
              return.

            <p>
              A form of metal that was forged in the Freehold of Valyria.
              Exceptionally sharp and strong, these weapons are known to be
              capable of killing White Walkers.

              Forged from the swords of Aegon the Conqueror's defeated enemies,
              the Iron Throne serves as both the physical seat of the King of
              the Andals and the First Men, and as a symbol of power in the
              Seven Kingdoms.
